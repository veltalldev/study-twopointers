### Problem: Two Sum (Sorted Array)

#### Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer `target`, find two numbers such that they add up to the `target`.

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-based) as an integer array `result` of size 2, where:
- `result[0] < result[1]`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

#### Example:
**Input**:
```plaintext
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
```

**Output**:
```plaintext
[1, 2]
```
